<h1>Sample multi-modal customer support agent for an airline with UI and function-calling.</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
Project consists of a Python-based multi-modal customer support agent built for airline service scenarios. The tool uses the ChatGPT o4-mini API to handle natural language input and supports both text and image-based queries. A Gradio interface provides a simple and accessible front end for interaction. At the moment, the project is based on a list of sample prices and locations, and can only get the ticket price. Function-calling tools are defined to handle each task, enabling the assistant to interact with backend systems in real-time.
